# Introduction to frontend modules

Frontend modules are the basic building blocks of O3. Frontend modules get organized into monorepos based on their specific domain. For example, frontend modules concerning the management of patients exist in the patient management repository. These include:

- [Appointments](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-management/tree/main/packages/esm-appointments-app)
- [Patient search](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-management/tree/main/packages/esm-patient-search-app)
- [Patient lists](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-management/tree/main/packages/esm-patient-list-app)
- [Patient registration](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-management/tree/main/packages/esm-patient-registration-app)
- [Service queues](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-patient-management/tree/main/packages/esm-outpatient-app)

Frontend modules are alternately referred to as `microfrontends` in O3. They get shipped in the ES module format, which explains the `esm-` prefix in their nomenclature. They get loaded into the application indirectly using a special JSON file called an [import map](http://localhost:3001/docs/core-concepts#import-map).

This diagram walks through what happens when the application gets executed. The app shell loads configuration files, the import map specifies where frontend modules get fetched from, and [loads frontend modules](/docs/frontend-modules/module-loading).

## Anatomy of a frontend module

Frontend modules export a predefined set of functionality. Each frontend module has a root-level `package.json` file that defines its dependencies and metadata.

<br />
<Image

/>

Key things to note from looking at this file include:

- The `name` property which defines the name of the module. This property is used as the module’s unique identifier in the import map.
- The `browser` property which is the entry point of the webpack bundle.
- The `main` property which represents entry point of the frontend module’s source code.

### The application entry point (`index.ts`)

Frontend modules have their [entry point](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/) defined in `src/index.ts`.

<br />
<Image
  src="/entrypoint.png"
  alt="Application entry point"

  height={500}
/>

This file is loaded by the app shell and must have a specific structure. It must have three exports: `setupOpenMRS`, `backendDependencies`, and `importTranslation`. The entry point communicates important information about the frontend module to app shell, including:

- The versions of backend dependencies used in the frontend module
- The module’s configuration schema
- Which React components to load (as determined in the pages and extensions configurations)
- The extensions that the module defines, in addition to the extension slots where they “plug into"
- Internationalization setup
- Breadcrumbs menu configuration

#### The `setupOpenMRS` function

Each frontend module defines a function named `setupOpenMRS`. This function performs any setup that should occur at the time the module gets loaded. It returns an object that communicates how the app shell should load the module. The setupOpenMRS function should only do the following four things:

- define the module's [configuration schema](config.md)
- register [breadcrumbs](breadcrumbs.md)
- set up [offline support](../offline/offline.md)
- return an object specifying the frontend module's pages and extensions

`setupOpenMRS` returns an object with two top-level keys, both optional: pages and extensions. Here is an example which uses all of the possible keys:

```ts copy
 const options =
    featureName: 'Hello World',
    moduleName: '@openmrs/esm-hello-world',
  };

  return {
    pages: [
      {
        // load (required): tells the app shell how to load the page content
        load: getAsyncLifecycle(() => import('./hello'), options),
        // route (required): a string, RegEx, function, or array of any of the
        //   above, which will be used to determine when to load the
        //   frontend module content. It will be matched against the URL path.
        route: 'hello',
        // order (optional): a number which specifies the order in which the
        // page should be loaded in the application. The default is 1. This
        // is generally only needed if you need to specify the DOM position
        // of your page; for example, if it is a navbar and needs to be at the
        // top, you might use order 0.
        order: 2,
        // `online`, `offline`, and `resources` are described in the offline
        //   support documentation. All are optional.
        online: { allowSayingHelloBack: true },
        offline: { allowSayingHelloBack: false },
        resources: { greeting: fetchGreetingOffline }
      },
    ],
    // To understand the `extensions` section, please read the "Extension System"
    // page of the documentation.
    extensions: [
      {
        // name (required): The name of the extension. Must be unique across
        // all modules in the application.
        name: 'greeting-bot',
        // load (required): tells the app shell how to load the extension content
        load: getAsyncLifecycle(() => import('./greeting-bot'), options),
        // slot (optional): Specifies a slot for the extension to be attached to.
        slot: 'bot-slot',
        // slots (optional): Alternative to `slot` which allows attaching to
        // multiple slots. For example:
        // slots: ['bot-slot', 'greeters-slot']

        // `online`, `offline`, and `resources` are described in the offline
        //   support documentation. All are optional.
        online: true,
        offline: true,
        resources: { greeting: fetchGreetingOffline }
      },
    ]
  };
```

##### Creating a page

Creating a page is a simple matter of creating the page as an application
in your framework of choice and then adding a loader to the `pages` array.
For example, you can create a React application as the default export
of a file `goodbye.tsx`. See
[`hello.tsx`](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-template-app/blob/master/src/hello.tsx)
for reference. You could then add this as a page to the application:

```typescript
    pages: [
      {
        load: getAsyncLifecycle(() => import('./hello'), options),
        route: 'hello',
      },
      {
        load: getAsyncLifecycle(() => import('./goodbye'), options),
        route: 'goodbye'
      }
    ],
```

#### The `backendDependencies` object

This is an object that tells the frontend application what OpenMRS server modules
the frontend module depends on, and what versions. If these dependencies are not
met, administrators will be alerted.

#### The `importTranslation` function

This is required for translations to work. It tells the frontend application
how to load translation strings. The boilerplate which you will find in
[openmrs-esm-template-app](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-esm-template-app/blob/master/src/index.ts)
is almost certainly what you want. Note that the first argument to
`require.context` is a directory, `../translations`.
That directory must exist at that location relative to the `index.ts` file.
