# Migrating to Core v5

## Introduction

O3 provides a powerful [module loading](/docs/frontend-modules/loading-modules) system that handles loading of frontend modules in the app shell. This system is leverages [Webpack module federation](/docs/frontend-modules/using-webpack) and forms the basis of our microfrontends architecture. However, it does suffer from a few historical drawbacks:

- All frontend modules get sequentially loaded at app startup time, which has a big performance impact.
- Because we're loading all modules at startup, we're also incurring the cost of executing all the dynamic import code for each module, even if the module is not used in the current page.

To address these issues, we've introduced a new version of the module loading system in Core v5. This new system essentially swaps out the app shell's implementation that loads all the frontend modules from the import map for an implementation that loads modules on demand. This means that modules are only loaded when they are needed, and only the code that is needed is executed. This yields a significant performance improvement (_we've seen an approximately 3x reduction in network requests needed to load the login page from local testing_).

To leverage these improvements, you'll need to migrate your existing frontend modules to Core v5. This guide will walk you through the process of doing so.

In general, you need to do the following:

1. [Factor out static metadata into a `routes.json` file](/docs/migration-guide#factor-out-static-metadata)
2. [Factor out dynamic metadata into a `startupApp` activator function](/docs/migration-guide#factor-out-dynamic-metadata)

## Factor out static metadata

Each frontend module defines a metadata that are either static or dynamic in nature. Static metadata include:

- `backendDependencies` - the exact versions of backend dependencies that the module depends on.
- `pages` - the pages that the module provides.
- `extensions` - the extensions that the module provides.

These metadata are static in the sense that they do not change at runtime. They are also the metadata that are used by the app shell to load the module. As such, they are the metadata that we need to factor out into a static `routes.json` file. A typical `routes.json` file looks like this:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json.openmrs.org/routes.schema.json",
  "backendDependencies": {
    "webservices.rest": ">=2.24.0"
  },
  "pages": [
    {
      // This named export is defined in the module's `index.ts` file. It is the unique identifier of the page.
      "component": "root",
      "route": "login",
      "online": true,
      "offline": true
    },
    {
      "component": "root",
      "route": "logout",
      "online": true,
      "offline": true
    }
  ],
  "extensions": [
    {
      "name": "location-picker",
      "slot": "location-picker",
      "component": "locationPicker",
      "online": true,
      "offline": true
    },
    {
      "name": "logout-button",
      "slot": "user-panel-actions-slot",
      "component": "logoutButton",
      "online": true,
      "offline": true
    },
    {
      "name": "location-changer",
      "slot": "user-panel-slot",
      "component": "changeLocationLink",
      "online": true,
      "offline": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The original `index.ts` file for the module looks like this:

```ts
import { getAsyncLifecycle, defineConfigSchema } from "@openmrs/esm-framework";
import { configSchema } from "./config-schema";

// The next two lines are no longer needed
declare var __VERSION__: string;
// __VERSION__ is replaced by Webpack with the version from package.json
const version = __VERSION__;

// This variable gets prefixed with `export `
const importTranslation = require.context(
  "../translations",
  false,
  /.json$/,
  "lazy"
);

const backendDependencies = {
  "webservices.rest": "^2.24.0",
};

const sharedOnlineOfflineProps = {
  online: {
    isLoginEnabled: true,
  },
  offline: {
    isLoginEnabled: false,
  },
};

// This function is renamed to `startupApp` and gets prefixed with `export `
function setupOpenMRS() {
  const moduleName = "@openmrs/esm-login-app";

  // This `options` variable and `moduleName` above it move outside the function body
  const options = {
    featureName: "login",
    moduleName,
  };

  // This function invocation moves outside the function body
  defineConfigSchema(moduleName, configSchema);

  // All of the following bits move out of this file and into a new file called `routes.json` (as shown above)

  // Each `page` and `extension` gets factored out into a named export that looks like this:
  /*   export const [namedExport] = getAsyncLifecycle(
    () => import(`path-to-component`),
    options
  ); */
  // These named exports move up to the top level of this file

  return {
    pages: [
      {
        load: getAsyncLifecycle(() => import("./root.component"), options),
        route: "login",
        ...sharedOnlineOfflineProps,
      },
      {
        load: getAsyncLifecycle(() => import("./root.component"), options),
        route: "logout",
        ...sharedOnlineOfflineProps,
      },
    ],
    extensions: [
      {
        name: "location-picker",
        slot: "location-picker",
        load: getAsyncLifecycle(
          () => import("./location-picker/location-picker.component"),
          options
        ),
        ...sharedOnlineOfflineProps,
      },
      {
        name: "logout-button",
        slot: "user-panel-actions-slot",
        load: getAsyncLifecycle(
          () => import("./logout/logout.component"),
          options
        ),
        online: true,
        offline: false,
      },
      {
        name: "location-changer",
        slot: "user-panel-slot",
        order: 1,
        load: getAsyncLifecycle(
          () => import("./change-location-link/change-location-link.component"),
          options
        ),
        ...sharedOnlineOfflineProps,
      },
    ],
  };
}

// This export is no longer needed
export { setupOpenMRS, importTranslation, backendDependencies, version };
```

## Factor out dynamic metadata

Dynamic metadata include:

- The `importTranslation` function.
- Named exports for `pages` and `extensions`.
- The `startupApp` activator function.
- The frontend module's `options` object.

The app shell does not need to know about these metadata at initial module load time. As such, frontend modules can retain these metadata in their `index.ts` files. However, they need to be moved outside of the `setupOpenMRS` function and prefixed with `export` so that they can be imported by the app shell at runtime.
